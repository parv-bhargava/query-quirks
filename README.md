3. **CPU Utilization:** CPU usage is indicative of how computationally intensive operations are for a database. High CPU usage can be a bottleneck in performance, especially when handling complex queries or large volumes of data. This project aims to compare the CPU utilization of the four databases under study, thereby providing a perspective on their computational efficiency.
This information is crucial for understanding the suitability of each database for different types of applications, especially those with limited computational resources.

By achieving these objectives, this project intends to offer a comprehensive understanding of the performance dynamics of these database systems. The results are expected to guide database administrators, system architects, and developers in making informed choices about the right database technology for their specific requirements. Whether it's for a high-traffic web application, a complex data analytics task, or efficient handling of large-scale distributed data, this study aims to provide critical insights that will aid in the optimization of data management strategies across various industries and applications

## Methodology
The methodology for the "Data Persistence and Performance Benchmarking Suite" project is structured around a series of Python scripts designed to automate data loading, query execution, and performance measurement across four different database systems: SQL, MongoDB, Neo4J, and Hadoop.

### Python Scripts for Data Loading and Query Execution
1. **Data Loading Scripts (batch_load.py, load.py):** These scripts facilitate the loading of data into each of the databases. The load.py script appears to be the main entry point for initiating the data loading process. It uses batch_load.py scripts specific to each database, which include functions to handle data in batches, ensuring efficiency and manageability. For instance, the MongoDB loading script (batch_load.py) employs the pandas library to process data in chunks, inserting them into the database using the PyMongo driver.
2. **Query Execution Scripts (query_mongo.py, query_neo4j.py, query_sql.py):** These scripts contain functions to execute various types of queries specific to each database. They are designed to handle different query operations, such as find and aggregate in MongoDB. The scripts establish connections to their respective databases and execute the provided queries, returning the results or handling exceptions as needed.

### Benchmarking Process
1. **Benchmark Script (benchmarks.py):** The core benchmarking is conducted through the benchmarks.py script. This script is responsible for measuring and recording the performance metrics during query execution. It utilizes functions like measure_query_time to record the time taken for query execution, and employs the psutil library to monitor CPU and memory usage, providing a comprehensive view of each database’s performance.template.
2. **Design and Selection of Queries:** The queries are designed to test a wide range of functionalities, including data insertion, retrieval, updates, and complex relationships (especially in Neo4J). The choice of queries seems to be influenced by their relevance to real-world applications, ensuring that the benchmarking reflects practical scenarios.
3. **Performance Measurement Technique:**
    -  Time Measurement: The time taken by each query is measured using Python’s time module, allowing for precise measurement of execution duration.
    -  CPU and Memory Usage Measurement: The psutil library is used to monitor CPU and memory usage during the execution of queries. This approach provides insights into how each query impacts the system resources.
4. **Result Plotting Script (plot_results.py):** The plot_results.py script is used to visualize the results of the benchmarks. It generates plots for query times, CPU usage, and memory usage, enabling a clear and visual comparison across different databases and queries.
5. **Main Execution Script (main.py):** The main.py script is the driver script that orchestrates the benchmarking process. It calls the necessary functions to run benchmarks and plot results, ensuring a streamlined execution of the project.
